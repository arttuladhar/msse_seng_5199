# What is Spock?
- Testing and specification framework
- Groovy and Java

# Why Spock?
- Simple
- Supports data-driven tests
- Great mocking support
- Integrates with tooling

---

# Simple Rules
- Extend Specification
- Fixture methods: setup, cleanup, setupSpec, cleanupSpec
- Define feature methods:
`def "pop items from stack"() { ... }`
- Blocks: setup, when, then, where, cleanup
