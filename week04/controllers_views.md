# Controllers & Views
## Mike Calvo

---
# Introduction to MVC Architecture
- Model: data specific to your system
- View: how your system is presented to the outside (UI or API)
- Controller: handles user interaction and external requests

---
# Servlets: The Original Controller
- Java specification for HTTP request processing (1997)
- Defined a web server component model for Java
- Servlet: component responsible for receiving an HTTP request and generating an HTTP response
- Lifecycle managed by the Java web server
- Tomcat was one of the first complete implementations

---
# Java Web History Since
- Abstraction layers on top of Servlets
- JavaServerPages (JSP) - servlets in the form of HTML templates
- Struts, JSF, SpringMVC
- People couldn't find the silver bullet

---
# Ruby on Rails
- In December 2005 version 1.0 released
- Based on a dynamic programming language: Ruby
- Favored convention over configuration
- Built around the DRY principle
- Huge productivity gains were observed

---
# Why Was Rails Faster?
- Project structure standard, generated, and consistent
- Dynamic language better at dealing with string-based HTML
- Less verbose configuration and code
  - Pick reasonable defaults
- Solved a specific problem that was very common

---
# Some in Java Took Note
- Grails 1.0 released in February 2008
- Based on JVM language Groovy
- Based on Spring and Hibernate
- Followed patterns popularized by Ruby on Rails

---
# Controllers
- Control the flow of a web application
- Handle inbound HTTP requests
- Decides what happens next
  - Execute another action
  - Renders a view page
  - Directly rener a response

---
# Controller Autowiring
- Like domain classes, controllers are provided many things automatically
- request: The inbound HTTP request being handled
- response: The outbound HTTP response
- session: An HTTP session for the current user
- services: Transactional logic for your application

---
# Controllers Done Easy: Scaffolding
- Automatically create CRUD UI for a domain class
- Not designed to be used as a production UI
- Good way to get started
- Dynamic and static options

---
# Dynamic Scaffolding
- Pages and action methods created at runtime
- No actual source exists
- Simply add the following line to a controller:
`static scaffold = true`

---
# Dynamic Scaffolding Provides
- List Page: paged, sortable table showing all instances
- Detail Page: create, edit, detail and update page
- Dynamically updates UI based on domain changes

---
# Static Scaffolding
- Generate the views and controller code for CRUD functionality
- Good way to learn how Grails works and a starting point for your own UI
- Produce static Scaffolding:
`./grailsw generate-all <domain-class>`

---
# Static Scaffolding: What's Generated?
- A controller with all crud action methods
  - show, create, save, edit, update and delete
- A collection of view files for create, edit, list and show

---
# Scaffolding: Not For Production!
- Scaffolding is a great way to get something up and running quickly
- Scaffolding is a great way to learn about Grails
- Scaffolding can help you get motivated by quick progress
- Scaffolding is an OK option for admin screens
- Once you become comfortable with Grails you'll develop better practices than those shown in scaffolding

---
# Real Programmers: Hand Code Controllers

---
# Controller Conventions
- All controllers live in grails-app/controllers
- Controllers are named consistently: <ControllerName>Controller
  `eg: ArtistController`
- Default convention for URL-to-controller mapping is
  `/controller/action/id`

---
# Crazy Simple Controller
```
class ArtistController {

  // Maps to /artist/get/id
  def get() {
    def artist = Artist.get(params.id)
    if (!artist) {
      response.sendError(404)
    } else {
      [ artist: artist ]
    }
  }
}
```

---
# Controller Unit Tests
- Let's look at a unit test for this simple controller
- Use @TestFor to tell Grails this is testing a controller
- Use @Mock to mock out domain interactions
